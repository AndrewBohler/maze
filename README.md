# maze
 Path finding through a 2D maze with python

This project was inspired by this YouTube video by Computerphile: https://youtu.be/rop0W4QDOUI

The code is likely much different from the video since (thus far) I didn't reference the video, other than from memory, while working on this project.

Run maze.py for a demo
save test_template.py as test.py and play around with it!
